<p>Alicrow Entertainment is a small independent game development team. This is a spare-time operation at the moment, but if things go well, we may be able to fix that.</p>

<p>We have two main projects at the moment: a 3D action-adventure game tentatively-titled LightAndDark, and our custom game creation system, known by the codename ScumOfTheEarth.</p>

<h3>
<a id="light-and-dark" class="anchor" href="#light-and-dark" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Light and Dark</h3>

<p>Light and Dark is a 3D action-adventure game set in a world ruled by the competing forces of Light and Dark.</p>

<p>The Light symbolizes certainty and knowledge. On the surface, the realm of Light appears to be a peaceful, tranquil place, full of fluffy bunnies and pretty meadows, but like most utopian societies, it comes at a price: anything that doesn't fit (predators, foreigners, new ideas, people with disabilities, et cetera) is eradicated by the Lightbringers, the human inhabitants altered by the Light's magic. They worship the Light as an all-knowing god, and have made it their mission to destroy anything that threatens the Light's perfection.</p>

<p>The Darkness symbolizes the unknown, the untameable, the eternal mystery. To most people, the realm of Darkness is like something out of a horror movie: a creepy forest full of bloodthirsty monsters. But to the Malhela, humans altered by the Darkness, it is a land of beauty, wonder, and life. For what meaning does life have unless it can be taken away in the blink of an eye? To the Malhela, nothing is ever certain, and nothing can be taken for granted. They worship the Darkness as the embodiment of all of life, which makes the Light the enemy of life itself.</p>

<p>ScumOfTheEarth, or SOTE, is a game creation system we're making as a more flexible and customizable alternative to conventional game engines like Unity3D.</p>

<p>Whereas engines like Unity restrict developers to the included subsystems (renderer, physics, networking, et cetera), SOTE aims to allow these systems to be swapped out to better suit the particular needs of the project (e.g. if you need a non-Newtonian physics engine (for some crazy but probably awesome reason), you can find one or make it yourself, then reconfigure SOTE to use it. Or if you just want to use your favorite scripting language, you can swap out the scripting engine).</p>

<p>By default, SOTE uses the same libraries we use, all of which are open source and cross-platform (Linux, OS X, and Windows). This applies to ALL of SOTE, not just the deployment libraries. The SOTE game editor runs natively on all three platforms (assuming nobody breaks the build).</p>

<p>Note that SOTE is in the early stages of development, and it's rather ugly. And that whole "swapping out the subsystems" thing isn't properly implemented yet. I don't recommend using it, but if you're curious, the repo is at <a href="https://github.com/WriterOfAlicrow/SOTE">https://github.com/WriterOfAlicrow/SOTE</a>.</p>
